# A timeline of life on earth spanning the last 4.5 billion years

![The timeline of the evolution of life](/LifeOnEarth_Timeline-v2.png)

## Definitions

â€“ An **eon**: is the largest division of geological time
  - An **era**: is a subdivision of an **eon**

## Specs:

- Created for a high school honors biology course project
- Made using **python 3.10** with the `matplotlib` and `numpy` libraries

- Open the [.py code file](/LifeOnEarth_timeline.py) to see the code itself
- Or the [.ipynb file](/LifeOnEarth_Timeline.ipynb) to see the history of the code and how it's taken shape

### To best view the notebook file (project history):

1. Download the `LifeOnEarth_Timeline.ipynb` file
2. Go to the Google Colab [website](https://colab.research.google.com/)
3. Select **Upload** and choose the dowloaded file
4. Have fun going through the history of the code!

### To run the code yourself:

Note: It is assumed that you already have **git**, and **python3** installed

1. First clone the repository to your device with `git clone https://github.com/art3m1s-dev/LifeOnEarth_Timeline.git` and cd into it with `cd LifeOnEarth_Timeline` 
2. Then install the dependencies with Python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Finally, run the program with `python3 LifeOnEarth_timeline.py`
