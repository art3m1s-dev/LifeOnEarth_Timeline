# A timeline of life on earth spanning the last 4.5 billion years

- Created for a high school honors biology course project
- Made using **python 3.10** with the `matplotlib` and `numpy` libraries

- Open the [.py code file](/LifeOnEarth_timeline.py) to see the code itself
- Or the [.ipynb file](/LifeOnEarth_Timeline.ipynb) to see the history of the code and how it's taken shape

### To best view the notebook file (project history):
1. Download the `LifeOnEarth_Timeline.ipynb` file
2. Go to the Google Colab [website](https://colab.research.google.com/)
3. Select **Upload** and choose the dowloaded file
4. Have fun going through the history of the code!
